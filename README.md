This CS 170 Project demonstrates the accuracy and efficiency of forward selection and backward elimination search algorithms.
It uses one-out validation as well as nearest neighbor to determine accuracy.

To run:
1. Download files to directory
2. In the terminal, run 'python main.py'
3. Type in the file name to read into the program
4. Choose a feature selection algorithm to use
5. Wait for results

- With large data sets, can be really slow
- If there are two feature subsets with the same accuracy, it may not pick the smaller subset
